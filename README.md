# SOFT
Style on the Fly - from shapefiles to webmaps with Python.

# Local Use
## This Django powered app is intended for local use in a web browser to generate a static HTTP webmap. If you want to modify it for a production use make sure you know what you are doing - the secret keep was intentionally left simple. A better way to do this would be to load in a secret key from a system environment variable to keep the secret key out of the source code.
